# ChromaShift

## Concept

**ChromaShift** is an interactive audiovisual installation that immerses the user in a virtual world where movement and emotion are directly connected.

A Kinect camera captures the user’s digital silhouette in real time and projects it onto a wall using a beamer.

The user stands at the center of the experience — their movements transform the world around them.

## Interactive Experience

At the beginning, the user enters a black-and-white world — empty, calm, and silent.  
Through interactions with specific virtual elements, the world begins to change:

- **Catching a shooting star:** Color flows into the scene and awakens the world.
- **Tearing open a rift:** A visual rupture — life and emotion return.
- **Picking a flower:** Everything fades back into black and white — a symbolic setback or new beginning.

Every action influences the atmosphere both visually and acoustically.  
The user becomes part of the digital stage — both performer and audience.
